# Vrungel

Vrungel is a Proof-of-Concept for a Kubernetes-native SIEM, specifically targetting RBAC events. Vrungel uses Discord as a logging endpoint, where users can triage and respond to logs, activating an automated GitOps workflow to push OPA Gatekeeper constraints to a policy-as-code repository.
